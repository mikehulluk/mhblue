Experimental investigation of simple nervous system preparations has 
a long history of uncovering fundamental issues about neuroscience: 
the generation of the action potential in squid giant axons, 
electrical coupling in escape responses, etc. In some Â systems, the 
neurons and their synaptic connections have been sufficiently well 
described that when computational models of these components are 
integrated, they produce similar behaviours to those seen in the 
real animal. 


One animal in which remarkable progress how a nervous system responds to 
stimuli to generate is the hatchling Xenopus tadpole.

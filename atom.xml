    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the main aims of this project is to explore the issues surrounding how simulations of nervous systems, composed of interconnected neurons, can be solved efficiently on electronic hardware.</p>

<p>To begin this project, I will start by:
a) Spending a few hours sitting down with the collaborators in the group working on the FPGAs, in order to understand the toolchain and how code is uploaded and run on the chips.
b) Come up with a simple C-model that can be used as basis for hand-mapping
onto the FPGA&rsquo;s. My plan is a small simulation of small numbers of different
types of (HH-type) neurons, synapses and gap junctions. The idea here is
understand the basic principles of how these can be mapped onto the FPGA. I
will start by looking at the C-tadpole model written by colleagues at the
University of Plymouth group. If this is more complex than what we need, I
think its only a couple of days work to reduce it to its bare-bones and write
it from scratch C. This will give us a simple test-case to work against.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From snails to scorpions to sea-lions, the nervous systems of animals play a
central role in generating behaviours. Nervous systems are though to be
composed of billions of specialised nerve cells, or <em>neurons</em>.  These neurons
have remarkable electrical properties and can actively respond to certain types
of stimulation.  Neurons can connect together either via direct electrical
connections, or via more complex chemical synapses.  In more complex animals,
like mammals, one hypothesis is that information is encoded in electrical
signals in the brain and that the different types of neurons and the specific
connections between them allows incoming sensory information to be filtered and
processed.</p>

<p>In the nervous systems of simpler animals, such as leechs and crabs, it has
been possible to isolate parts of the nervous systems that generate specific
behaviours such as the heartbeat and chewing in the stomach, MORE&hellip;.</p>

<p>Over the last few decades, dramatic developments in experimental techniques
have made it possible to investigate what gives neurons their active electrical
properties, and it has been possible to build mathematical models to predict
their responses to stimulation, as well as the how neurons interact with each
other.</p>

<p>Since we can model the individual components, and the interactions between
them, a natural question to ask is do our models of nervous systems generate
similar outputs to those seen experimentally? Is the whole really the sum of
the parts?  Unfortunately, these systems are mathematically non-tractable and
need to be solved by simulation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these systems can also be large! The human nervous system
contains XX neurons. We need to find efficient ways to run our simulations. One
approach we will try to exploit is that neuronal systems seem to be
<em>embarrassingly parallel</em>, &hellip; MORE</p>

<p>I will be working with Simon Moore and Robert Cannon on this project, &hellip; MORE</p>
